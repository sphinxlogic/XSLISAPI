<!-- This sample is to demonstrate encoding and character set mechanism in XSLISAPI 2.0.
      In the config files, the <output> parameter is used to specifiy the encoding and character
      set being used by the XML data. The code page is used during the transformation and the 
      character setting is used by the client software to render appropriately.

      Sample scenario: We will set the code page for Chinese and the character set for traditional 
      Chinese. All text will appear in the traditional Chinese character set. The page will contain a 
      list of colors (e.g. red, blue, green, orange and yellow). In the XSL stylesheet for the HTML 
      version of the site the names of the colors will appear in a table with a "swatch" of the same 
      color appearing in the cell to the right of the name. In the XSL stylesheet for the WML 1.1 version 
      the list of colors will appear in a list with one color per line. In the HDML version of the site the 
      colors will appear separate by a commas (and not in a list).

         The reason of using it over encoding is that this will trigger IE5 to
         prompt for the installation of the language pack of Chinese characters
         if it has not been installed.  Simply setting the encoding would not
         trigger the prompt of the installation and the content would not be
         displayed properly.
